# Local_expo_setup


Here are the steps to set up a local Expo development environment:

1. Install Node.js and npm: Expo requires Node.js and npm to be installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official website and npm will be included with Node.js.

2. Install the Expo CLI: Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can install the Expo CLI globally by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```
   npm install -g expo-cli
   ```

3. Create a new Expo project: You can create a new Expo project by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```
   expo init my-project
   ```

   This will create a new directory named `my-project` and initialize it with a basic Expo project template.

4. Start the development server: Change to the project directory and start the development server by running the following command:

   ```
   cd my-project
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the Expo development server and open a web browser with the Expo developer tools. You can use the developer tools to preview your app, debug your code, and configure your app settings.

5. Install the Expo app on your mobile device: To test your app on a physical device, you need to install the Expo app on your mobile device. You can download the Expo app from the App Store (iOS) or Google Play (Android).

6. Scan the QR code: Once you have installed the Expo app on your mobile device, you can use it to scan the QR code displayed in the Expo developer tools. This will load your app on your device and allow you to test it in real-time.
7. Extra notes: npm install to install necessary packages
8. Extra notes: npx expo start to run the project and generate QR code
